# Edge-Detection-Canny-Method
The objective of the program given is to perform edge detection of images in real-time. In this article, the popular canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect a wide range of edges in images. OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() which takes our input image as first argument and its aperture size(min value and max value) as last two arguments. This is a simple example of how to detect edges in Python.

Steps to download the requirements below:

Download Python 2.7.x version, numpy and OpenCV 2.7.x or 3.1.0 version.Check if your Windows either 32 bit or 64 bit is compatible and install accordingly.
Make sure that numpy is running in your python then try to install opencv.
